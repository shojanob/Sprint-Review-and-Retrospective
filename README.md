Reflection on Agile Development and Software Engineering Practices

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing on the problem the user is trying to solve rather than jumping directly to technical solutions. Creating user stories helps translate abstract requirements into concrete, testable goals written from the user’s perspective. By using the format “As a user, I want…, so that…,” I was able to clearly understand intent, prioritize value, and define acceptance criteria before writing any code. In the SNHU Travel project, user stories guided both development and testing, ensuring the final product aligned with user expectations even when requirements changed.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively, breaking large problems into smaller, manageable pieces that can be designed, implemented, tested, and reviewed incrementally. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives help keep work focused and adaptable. I plan to continue using user stories, incremental delivery, continuous testing, and frequent feedback loops in future projects. These practices reduce risk, improve quality, and make it easier to respond to changing requirements without restarting development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and taking shared responsibility for the success of the product. It involves being receptive to feedback, helping teammates when blockers arise, and prioritizing team goals over individual preferences. In an Agile environment, this also means actively participating in Scrum events, keeping work visible, and contributing to continuous improvement. Strong teamwork leads to better problem-solving, higher-quality software, and a more sustainable development process.
